HowTo create a Bitecoin and Litecoin Node for Ubuntu with PHP Status and VNStat
********

After deploying several Bitcoin's and Litecoin's node I've found that it would be much easier just to make a script to be deployed on a brand new Ubuntu server and just making it the more easy to do as possible.
So this is my first attempt in doing so, hope you enjoy :-D

What to expect?
- Full Bitcoin and Litecoin node
- Vnstat
- bitcoind-status from craigwatson @ github

Where does it came from? Copyright?
- GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3.0 (so just use and abuse :-D )
- Bitcoind-status: All Rights Reserved to https://github.com/craigwatson
- Took same stuff from https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum-server/blob/master/HOWTO.md and https://github.com/pooler/electrum-ltc-server/blob/master/HOWTO.md

NOTE:
If you use the install_btc_ltc.sh don't forget to: chmod +x install_btc_ltc.sh

If you have any questions or remarks feel free to speak up.
