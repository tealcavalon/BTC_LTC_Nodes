HowTo create a Bitecoin and Litecoin Node for Ubuntu

After deploying several Bitcoin's and Litecoin's node I've found that it would be much easier just to make a script to be deployed on a brand new Ubuntu server and just making it the more easy to do as possible.
So this is my first attempt in doing so, hope you enjoy it :-D

What to expect?
- Full Bitcoin and Litecoin node
- Vnstat
- bitcoind-status from craigwatson @ github

If you use the install_btc_ltc.sh don't forget to: chmod +x install_btc_ltc.sh

If you have any questions or remarks feel free to speak up.
